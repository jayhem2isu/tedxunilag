                        TED is an annual event that brings together the brightest minds of our generation
                        to share their ideas with a curated audience of open-minded individuals. Based
                        on any number of subjects, these “TED Talks”, are then made available online for 
                        TEDx
                        free so that their ideas may be spread throughout the world.

                        TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, "ideas worth spreading." The
                        program is designed to give communities, organizations and individuals the
                        opportunity to create TED-like experiences at the local level through their own
                        event. Since the program’s creation, more than 10,000 TEDx events have spread
                        throughout the world in places like Dubai, Tokyo, Antarctica, and, of course,
                        Unilag. At TEDx events, a screening of TEDTalks videos -- or a combination of live
                        presenters and TEDTalks videos -- sparks deep conversation and connections.
                        TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a 
                        community-by-community basis.

                        TEDxUnilag was created out of the belief in the importance of learning and passing
                        knowledge in our immediate environment and the society a large, as well as a need
                        to provide insight on addressing the problems facing our society and ways to
                        overcome these problems as individuals and as a whole. The first TEDxUnilag event
                        held in March 2015 with a desire to develop connections, raise awareness, 
                        collaborate, and most importantly, innovate and learn.
                        As a volunteer-only organization, organisers, volunteers and speakers are not paid.
                        Instead, we oﬀer a global community and platform for launching unique ideas. 
                        Speakers have included a spoken word artiste, a doctor, a designer, a financial and
                        tax consultant, an author, musicians and more
                        Our mission is to bring together leading thinkers and doers to share ideas that
                        matter in and to any discipline.
                        Our vision is to establish a platform that will educate entertain and provoke
                        conversations that will continue long after this event is over; promote
                        conversations and share ideas that will provide insight for individuals within the 
                        community and the community as a whole
